### What I learned

hi everyone ;) in this challenge I faced some excellent challenges regarding the layout of the various sections and the management of the various svg images such as that of the **hero-section**, but above all the **Tab-sections** helped me train list and **FAQ-section** in which I had to both arrange the individual components as best as possible and execute adequate **JS** code.

This time too I tried to use the CSS compilation technique called **CUBE CSS** to try to keep the code as clean as possible and avoid repetitions; however, I don't think I did it as best as I could....I can improve

### Continued development

I will definitely continue on this line of challenges, which have a good dose of **layout management** and **JS** part in order to improve more and more ;)
