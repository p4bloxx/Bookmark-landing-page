### What I learned

hello everyone ;) in this challenge I faced some excellent challenges regarding the management of the layout of the various sections and the management of the various images in SVG format such as that of the **hero-section**; But above all, both the **Tab-sections** and the **FAQ section** helped me manage a slightly more complex layout and match the appropriate **JS** code.

This time too I tried to use the CSS compilation technique called **CUBE CSS** to try to keep the code as clean as possible and avoid repetitions; However, I don't think I did it to the best of my ability...

### Continued development

I will definitely continue on this line of challenges, which have a good dose of **layout management** and **JS** part in order to improve more and more ;)
